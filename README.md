About 71 percent of the Earth's surface is water-covered and only about 0.3 percent of our  fresh water is found in the surface water of lakes, rivers, and swamps. In developing  countries, 70 percent of industrial wastes are dumped untreated into waters, polluting the  usable water supply. On average, 22 million tons of fertilizers and chemicals are used each  year. This product is designed with an intention of cleaning the water debris floating on the lake,  ponds etc. we can collect many floating wastes like plastic bottles, bags, flowers without any  human interference and then dispose the waste easily, one can clean the lake just by operating  it with the help of remote control. Also, our product help in reducing the water pollutants to a  certain extent. The major advantage is the safety provided by our product that is one need not  risk his life while he is cleaning the lake and we just need one person to control the drone.  The product is socially helpful for the labourers who clean the lake and economically viable.  If the product is used in large numbers, it would be a perfect example for “Technological  application in environmental protection”.
